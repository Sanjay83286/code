    <h1><center>FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT</center></h1>
    <b>Frontend:</b>Frontend is used to view or collect the data.
we use HTML& CSS to showcase our data
we use javascript to collect data from the user.
<br>
<b>*Backend :</b>
Backend is mostly deals with the logical part of the Application.
it deals with the Apis and server part it takes requests from user and sends response to the client.<br> and also it integrates with database.
<b>Database:</b>Database deals with the data it stores the data from which was given by user and validates the data.and also it manipulates the data.
why we only stores the data in the database ??<br>
Because of database provides security and data manipulations to the data.
And it provides accessibility to any server.<br>
Why dont we store data in the local storage??<br>
if brwe store the data in the local storage it cant be accessible to the servers.
only we can access data in our computer only..
why dont we store data in the server??<br>
if we store the data in the server it takes more time to procces the application it slows downs the performance of application<br>

<b>1. Front-End Development (Client-side)</b>
This is the part of the application that users interact with directly. Front-end developers create the visual aspects of a website or application.
Technologies:
<br>
HTML (HyperText Markup Language): Structure of web pages.<br>
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Layout and styling of web pages.<br>
JavaScript: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.<br>
Frontend Frameworks/Libraries: React, Angular, Vue.js, Svelte.<br>
<b>2. Back-End Development (Server-side)</b>
This is the part of the application that manages and serves data. Back-end developers create the logic, databases, and server-side infrastructure that make the web application run.
Technologies:<br>
Programming languages: Node.js (JavaScript), Python (Django, Flask), Ruby (Rails), PHP, Java (Spring), C# (.NET)<br>
<b>3.Database</b>
A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It is designed to store data in a structured way so that it can be retrieved, updated, or manipulated efficiently. 
Relational Databases (RDBMS):<br>
Store data in structured tables with predefined relationships between them<br>
MySQL
Oracle Database<br>
NoSQL Databases:<br>
NOsql Database:<br>
These databases are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data 
MongoDB (Document-based)<br>
Cassandra (Column-family based)
<br>
<b>4. DevOps and Deployment</b>
Full-stack developers often work with DevOps tools and practices to deploy and maintain applications.

. Server<br>
A server is a computer, device, or software program that provides services, resources, or data to other computers, known as clients, over a network. Servers are typically more powerful and have greater storage and processing capacity than client devices
. Client<br>
A client is a computer, device, or software program that makes requests to a server for resources, data, or services. The client usually interacts directly with the end-user and displays data received from the server.
What is an API?<br>
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application to interact with another. It defines how different software components should communicate and exchange data, often between a client and a server.
In simpler terms, an API is like a messenger that takes requests from the client (e.g., a web browser or mobile app) to the server, processes the request, and returns the response back to the client.
What is DNS Lookup?<br>
DNS (Domain Name System) lookup is the process of translating a human-readable domain name (like www.example.com) into its corresponding IP address (such as 192.0.2.1). The DNS system is crucial for navigating the internet, as it enables devices to locate and connect to web servers using domain names instead of numerical IP addresses.
Browser <br>
A browser (or web browser) is a software application that allows users to access, retrieve, and view content on the World Wide Web (WWW). It interprets and displays the data found on websites, allowing users to interact with text, images, videos, and other resources.
Local storage<br>
Local Storage is a web storage feature provided by web browsers that allows websites to store data locally on a user's device, within the browser, in a key-value pair format
